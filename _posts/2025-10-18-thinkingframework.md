# The thinking framework

## (a summary)

  1. Start your day with your heart pumping. The only way I’ve found to not feel like death the rest of the day.

  2. Be fearless. Use the prayer to control fear in your heart. Fear will also prevent divergent thinking. It forces your brain to apply known patterns and take the well trodden paths. This is true on both a micro and macro scale.

  3. Have faith in yourself. You can innovate and discover and create new things. Have the intention to create new things.

  4. Maintain a singing heart and a twinkle in your eye. The feeling of desperation, fear, or anger can’t lead to truly extraordinary work. I believe this based on faith.

  5. Allocate your brain on things you care about. Make forward progress. Add depth. Do not run in circles. Time allocation moulds who you become. This is cool because you can choose who to become by allocating time on things which mould you to be who you want to be.

  6. Just start doing something. Do things which you don’t know how to do.

  7. Add depth to your work. Depth adds value.

  8. There is a ton of alpha in doing something other people are not willing to do. Taking an action which is out of distribution in any given environment can lead to out of distribution outcomes. Extreme actions lead to extreme results.

  9. Take commitment risk. Commit to a project and see it through even though it might not be the most optimal time allocation.

  10. Move faster. Trying more things quickly is necessary to explore the space of possibilities.

  11. Publish what you’ve been working on, show it to people.

  12. Fluid intelligence is the ability to not jump to conclusions based on the initial pattern match and to explore other possibilities. The brain claws onto an idea which is exciting, but there might be other ways to think about the problem. The two ways I’ve found to allow your brain to make divergent connections is to a) walk away and come back b) intentionally allocate time to explore the problem without any rush. b) allows you to view information present in the problem which you’re missing. c) sketch out what’s actually happening in the system which you’re thinking about.

  13. Don’t jump to conclusions. When the brain latches on to an idea, it’s worth performing a verification step to make sure the idea is on the right track.

  14. Sustain longer chains of thought without getting distracted.

  15. Draw conclusions from the trees you’re exploring to prevent circular thinking.

  16. It’s worth it to do the upfront work to make your mental model of the problem clear, before beginning the work. Saves a lot of pain regarding backtracking.

  17. Plan before doing if the thing you’re doing will take some time. This is a judgement call on whether you think planning will take more time than just doing the thing.

  18. Don’t rush. Rushing leads to sloppy allocation of time on whatever you’re working on. Leads to worse mental models, worse insights, worse quality of work, missing obvious information right in front of you, and a feeling of unease and nervousness.

  19. Solutions can be ambiguous as long as they’re directionally correct. Make things better.

  20. Not taking any risk is riskier in the long term.

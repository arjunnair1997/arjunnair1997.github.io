## About

I'm an engineer. Currently I work at [Warpstream Labs](https://www.warpstream.com/). I truly enjoy thinking, running experiments, climbing, and reading.

## Climbing Wall

This is my climbing wall which I built from scratch using my own two hands! It is 50 degrees overhanging from vertical and has holds
which are less than 10mm deep. Awesome. The wall is 9.5 feet tall along the incline and 8 feet wide.

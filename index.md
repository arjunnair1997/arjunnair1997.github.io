## About

I'm an engineer. I love thinking, running experiments, climbing, and reading.

Currently I work at [Warpstream Labs](https://www.warpstream.com/) where I solve hardcore problems. My proudest achievement at my job so far is making the most crucial bottleneck in the system 3x faster allowing the system to handle unimaginable workloads!

## Climbing Wall

This is my climbing wall which I built from scratch using my own two hands! It is 50 degrees overhanging from vertical and has holds
which are less than 10mm deep. Awesome. The wall is 9.5 feet tall along the incline and 8 feet wide.
